                  The Transition Town movement has helped communities around the world reduce their carbon footprint
                  through local food production, renewable energy projects, and skill-sharing initiatives.

                <p>
                  In Totnes, UK, the original Transition Town, community-owned renewable energy projects now generate
                  enough electricity for hundreds of homes, while local food initiatives have significantly reduced food
                  miles.

                  Copenhagen has transformed into one of the world's most bicycle-friendly cities, with over 62% of
                  residents commuting by bike daily. This has reduced the city's carbon emissions by thousands of tons
                  annually.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The city achieved this through dedicated infrastructure, policy changes, and cultural shifts that
                  prioritized cycling over car travel.

                  In the United States, community solar projects allow residents to share the benefits of solar power
                  even if they can't install panels on their own homes.

                  These projects have enabled thousands of households to access clean energy while creating local jobs
                  and reducing carbon emissions by millions of tons.
